# Note to TA
Implemented the model for habit, habitList, testUnits and some activities only.
You can add habits and view them after being added. When you add habit date, the text field doesn't automatically fill in the date, since that function is not implemented. A quick fix was to create a new date object inside AddNewHabitActivity.
